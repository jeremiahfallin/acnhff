Created with Gatsby. A tool for helping players of Animal Crossing: New Horizons find the 10 villagers they should be seeking in their game. Originally there were 391 villagers, but now there are only over 400 after two new updates.

Uses the [Villager API](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Villager_API) with gatsby-node to create a list of villagers and their information so that new additional villagers added to the game can be added to the site with a rebuild.
